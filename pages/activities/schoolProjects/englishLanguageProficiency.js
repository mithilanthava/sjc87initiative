            <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-500 font-bold mt-8 text-left">Two main issues affect English Language Proficiency in the Northern Province:</p>
            <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-500 font-light mt-3 text-justify md:text-left"><span className="font-semibold">Teacher Training:</span> Thirty years of civil war has prohibited the system from creating quality English teachers. The current English teachers, although well knowledgeable, have limited student â€“ teacher interactive language skills. We have organized a number of teacher training conferences conducted by leading experts in the field of teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages. We also work with other organizations such as OPEnE (Organization of People for Engagement and Enterprise) in the same field to improve efficiencies.</p>

            <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-500 font-light mt-3 text-left"><span className="font-semibold">Fundamentals at Early Ages</span> We are trying to introduce and stress the importance of READING, COMPREHENSION and WRITING skills at early ages. Apart from reading books, we have worked with OPEnE in providing pen drives containing self learning exercises to students so that they can learn English on their own from early ages to GCE O/L. These self-learning techniques help each student according to their level of ability.</p>
